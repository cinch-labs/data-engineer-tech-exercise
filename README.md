# Snowflake Data Exercise - Starter Project

### Prerequisites

#### Install Python 3.8.* or later.

See installation instructions at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Check you have python3 installed:

    python3 --version

### Dependencies and data

#### Creating a virtual environment

Ensure your pip (package manager) is up to date:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip

To check your pip version run:

    pip3 --version


Create the virtual environment in the root of the cloned project:

    python3 -m venv .venv

#### Activating the newly created virtual environment

You always want your virtual environment to be active when working on this project.

    source ./.venv/bin/activate

#### Installing Python requirements

This will install some of the packages you might find useful:

    pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt

#### Generating the data

A data generator is included as part of the project in `./input_data_generator/main_data_generator.py`
This allows you to generate a configurable number of months of data.
Although the technical test specification mentions 6 months of data, it's best to generate
less than that initially to help improve the debugging process.

To run the data generator use:

    python3 ./input_data_generator/main_data_generator.py

This should produce customers, products and transaction data under `./input_data/starter`

#### Getting started

Please save Snowflake model code in `snowflake` and infrastructure code in `infra` folder.

Update this README as code evolves, documenting the build.
